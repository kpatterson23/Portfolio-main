                <p>I didn't immediately know what I wanted to do upon graduating from college. I tried working a help desk position, but my heart wasn't in the work. Then I discovered computer programming and I've loved every minute!
                </p>
                <p>As a student at Thinkful, I'm solidifying my skills to be the best web developer I could possibly be.
                </p>
                <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer for your team or project, feel free to reach out! I'm so excited to help build the best websites around!
